2.Advanced Concepts- Discuss the advanced topics, use technical data, and provide in-depth analysis or technical specifications.
3.Precision: Be precise and use technical language that aligns with their knowledge base.
B.Regular Folks
1.Simplified Language- Use of plain language and avoid jargon. 
2.Basic Concepts- Focus on foundational concepts and practical applications rather than technical specifics.
3.Clarity- Ensure the explanations are clear, straightforward, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
